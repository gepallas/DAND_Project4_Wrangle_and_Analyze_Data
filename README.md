# Wrangle and Analyze Data
This project has been completed as part of the [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) requirements.

## Overview
In this project tweet data from the popular [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) twitter account are gathered, assessed, cleaned, analyzed and visualized.

The main effort in this project was to gather, assess and clean the data.

### Data gathering
Data for the tweets are gathered from:
- an archive file provided from Udacity
- through the twitter API to gather additional information (retweet and favorite counts) for those tweets that are contained in the archive

In addition, image prediction data are also gathered through a url provided from Udacity.

### Data assessment
Data have been assessed for quality and tidiness issues.

Example of quality issues with regard to the data:
- Completeness
- Validity
- Accuracy
- Consistency

Format of tidiness followed:
- Each variable forms a column
- Each observation forms a row
- Each type of observational unit forms a table

Visual and programmatic assessment has been applied to the data to identify quality and tidiness issues.

### Data cleaning
The issues identified have been cleaned.

For the cleaning process the following format is applied:
- Define
- Code
- Test

Between the cleaning steps, re-assessment of the data has been performed.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
After cleaning the data, analysis and visualization is performed, in order to gain insights regarding the tweets and the twitter account.
